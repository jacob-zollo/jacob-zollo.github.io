	<h2>
	Where I Started
	</h2>
		<p>I'm 28 years old, I have a beautiful wife of (nearly) one year and I've lived in Texas my entire life.
		</p>
		<p>I have a love of cars, art and video games. I've moved from Corpus Christi, to Houston, back to Corpus Christi until finally moving to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and hopping around the surrounding mid-cities. I've had many aspirations in life, including: paleontologist, aeronautical engineer, graphic designer, social media manager and now developer. I finally started a career in graphic design, in which I'm a 100% self-taught. Surprisingly, I'm also colorblind so that's a nice extra level of difficulty thrown in. I even tried took a stab at video editing recently, which you can see in the following video I'm both embarrassed and extremely proud of.</p>

	<h2>
	Where I Am
	</h2>
		<p>I currently work as a graphic designer, as I have been for the past 5 years. Completely randomly, one day I started to research what it takes to learn to code and becoming a developer. I still don't know what started it, but I had an "itch" suddenly. I was at work and looked up "learn to code" on Spotify. The first podcast that pulled up was exactly that, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2dGDlNN7GOqJjy7Qlr3ECF?si=ce69e59ff31c437b" target="_blank">"Learn to Code" by One Month.</a> I listened to those episodes all day and was hooked. After about a week of listening, I talked to my wife and decided to start this path. I signed up for the classes at <a href="https://onemonth.com" target="_blank"> One Month</a> and here I am, making a portfolio from scratch as my first lesson.</p>
		<p>I'm excited to start this new adventure and One Month has been a great first step for me. I'm consistently excited to get home and start another lesson to get me closer to where I want to be.</p>
